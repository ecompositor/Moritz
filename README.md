Contains a set of related Windows desktop programs, written in C#, that I use for creating scores.

This is a large, unwieldy set of libraries, and the result of many years programming during which I learned and forgot a lot of C#. So some parts of it are pretty beastly. But it works, and some parts of it are still being developed. I don't have time to start again from scratch (as I should).

Anyone is welcome to dive in if they want to, but I don't really recommend doing that without my help. If you really want to know how the symbols are spread across systems, the best would be to ask me where to look. :-)
